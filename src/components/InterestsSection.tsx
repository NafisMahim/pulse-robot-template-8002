              Since childhood, I've always wondered how machines work, technology works, and how phones work. 
              Carrying this mindset, I became interested in the works of the two tech giants, Apple and Google, 
              of which I want to work in some day.

              I have experience with CSS, Python, JavaScript, and HTML, and am planning on majoring in Computer Science.

              My father had heavy influence on me when it came to business interests. He studied finance and had a business major. 
              From a young age, I've learned about the stock market, investments, and became interested in entrepreneurship. 
              As a result, I also plan on majoring in Finance alongside CS.
