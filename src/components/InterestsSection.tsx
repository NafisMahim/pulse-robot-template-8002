              Since childhood, I've always wondered how machines work, technology works, and how phones work. 
              Carrying this mindset, I became interested in the works of the two tech giants, Apple and Google, 
              of which I want to work in some day.

              My father had heavy influence on me when it came to business interests. He studied finance and had a business major. 
              From a young age, I've learned about the stock market, investments, and became interested in entrepreneurship. 
              As a result, I also plan on majoring in Finance alongside CS.
